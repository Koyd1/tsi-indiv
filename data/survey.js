- The number of root-level rights is minimized
- Unnecessary access rights are disabled
- Unnecessary functions and services are deactivated
- Access to powerful utilities and important settings is strictly controlled
- The clocks are synchronized

If the backup is the responsibility of the partner, we will find out:

- How comprehensively does the partner back up the data?
- How the data can be recovered if necessary?
- How the backups are agreed in the contracts?

If the backup is our own responsibility, we will find out:

- Whether the data backup process exists and is documented?
